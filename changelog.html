    <h2>Changelog</h2>
    <p id="topmsg">This page lists the changes to the redundancy checker, if said changes had an effect on the behaviour of the check</p>

    </ul>

    <h4>May 17, 2015</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Modified</b>the future options <samp>$generichide</samp> and <samp>$genericblock</samp> are still ignored, but no longer trigger error messages</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>March 9, 2015</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>New</b>domain check tool: add option to export the current results, which can also be used to resume the check at a later moment</li>

    <ul>
      <li><b>New</b>tool to detect dead, redirected or parked first party domains (requires Chrome)</li>
      <li><b>Fix</b>sometimes multiple warnings were shown per rule, instead of only the most important warning (<samp>$domain=a.|b|a.</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Modified</b>tightened the triggering conditions for the warning about a blocking rule being a broken hiding exclusion rule</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>January 5, 2015</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>New</b>warning if the value of a blocking option contains a <samp>$</samp> which should probably be a <samp>,</samp> (<samp>$domain=abc$image</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Improved</b>warning messages when invalid domain separators are found (<samp>$domain=a||b</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Improved</b>warning messages related to incorrectly used blocking options (<samp>$image=foo</samp> or <samp>$~domain=foo</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Improved</b>warning messages related to overruled blocking options (<samp>$image,~image,script</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Fix</b><samp>$document</samp> rules did not take into account the trailing dot domain variant for blocking rules with <samp>$domain=...</samp> (<samp>@@||abc.def^$document</samp> and <samp>$domain=abc.def</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Fix</b>multiple warnings with shared rules should only be filtered out if all rules are identical (<samp>@@||a^$elemhide</samp> should warn against both <samp>c,a##.adv</samp> and <samp>a,b##.ads</samp> at the same time)</li>
      <li><b>Fix</b>warnings for a mutually redundant, equal length rule were dependent on the position of the other rule in the filters (<samp>##.A.\30 .B</samp> and <samp>##.A.B.\30 </samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Fix</b><samp>:not(...)</samp> selectors were not checked for conflicts when '<samp>not</samp>' contained capital letters (<samp>##div:NOT(div)</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Fix</b>whitelisted rules containing the <samp>$collapse</samp> option did not make blocking rules without <samp>$collapse</samp> redundant</li>
      <li><b>Fix</b><samp>$match-case,~match-case</samp> was treated as <samp>$match-case</samp></li>
      <li><b>Fix</b>whitelist rules that imply <samp>$document</samp> were made redundant by rules that do not imply <samp>$document</samp> if no options were present (<samp>@@|http://</samp> was made redundant by <samp>@@http</samp>)</li>

      <li><b>Modified</b>known options are now shown uniformly in warning messages (lowercased, without spaces and using underscores)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>July 7, 2014:</h4>

      <li><b>New</b>warn about rules with contradicting <samp>:nth-*</samp> selectors as they cannot match anything (<samp>##:nth-child(3):nth-child(4)</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>New</b>warn about selectors with different values for attribute selectors with the operators <samp>^=</samp> and <samp>|=</samp>, as they cannot match anything (<samp>##[attr^=&quot;cow&quot;][attr|=&quot;dog&quot;]</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>New</b>warn about rules containing <samp>:not(...)</samp> pseudo-classes that cannot coexist with other selector types in the same rule (<samp>##:not([class=&quot;ads&quot;]).adv</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>New</b>detect redundancies between rules containing <samp>:not(...)</samp> pseudo-classes and rules containing other selector types (<samp>##:not([class=&quot;ads&quot;])</samp> versus <samp>##.adv</samp>)</li>

      <li><b>New</b>rules containing <samp>:not(...)</samp> pseudo-classes are no longer only literally compared against other <samp>:not(...)</samp> selectors (<samp>##:not([href*=&quot;a&quot;])</samp> and <samp>##:not([href=&quot;ads&quot;])</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Improved</b>the warning messages that tell you about conflicts within a rule are more specific (<samp>##[id=&quot;a&quot;][id^=&quot;b&quot;]</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Improved</b>the warning messages that tell you about redundancies within a rule are more specific (<samp>###ads,div#ads</samp>)</li>

      <li><b>Modified</b>attribute selector combinations that can't coexist do not match other impossible combinations anymore (<samp>###a#b</samp> and <samp>##[id=&quot;a&quot;][id^=&quot;b&quot;]</samp>)</li>

      <li><b>New</b>detect redundancies in hiding rules if a <samp>#@#</samp> rule excluded part of the rule (example: <samp>nl#@##ads</samp> and <samp>###ads</samp> together with <samp>com##div#ads</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Improved</b>all warnings for redundant domains now clearly state which domains can be removed</li>

      <li><b>Fix</b><samp>/\|\|x/$document</samp> and similar regex rules with <samp>$document</samp> or <samp>$elemhide</samp> no longer make <samp>$domain=x</samp> or <samp>x##y</samp> redundant</li>
      <li><b>UI</b>in case a rule could be made redundant by two rules, and those rules are no redundancies of each other, the shortest rule is now displayed</li>

    <h4>November 16, 2013:</h4>
    <ul>

      <li><b>Fix</b>if A is made redundant by B and B is made redundant by a <samp>$document</samp> or <samp>$elemhide</samp> rule C, A must be redundant of C instead of B</li>
      <li><b>Fix</b>more warning messages in which the options were shown as lowercased and with all <samp>-</samp> replaced by <samp>_</samp></li>

      <li><b>Fix</b>rules with duplicates of <samp>:not(...)</samp> selectors and another comma-separated selector, acted as if <samp>:not(...)</samp> was <samp>*</samp> (<samp>##:not(a):not(a ),x</samp>)</li>

      <li><b>UI</b>fix typo in warning message for <samp>:not(...)</samp> selectors that match every element (<samp>##:not(:nth-child(-4))</samp>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>September 20, 2013:</h4>
    <ul>

      <li><b>Improved</b>better warning message for rules of the form <samp>@@domain##rule</samp></li>
      <li><b>Improved</b>better error message for incorrectly excluded domains (<samp>abc$~domain=site.com</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Fix</b>in the error message <em>unknown option 'X'</em>, any <samp>-</samp> in the option was replaced by <samp>_</samp>, and it was in lowercase (example: <samp>abc$First-Party</samp>)</li>

      <li><b>Fix</b>incorrect warning message for comma-separated hiding rules for which one part can't match anything (<samp>##div,:not(*)</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Fix</b>do not automatically assume case insensitivity for browser-specific pseudo selectors (<samp>##:moz-whatever(x)</samp> versus <samp>##:moz-whatever(X)</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Modified</b>rules that match nothing (example: <samp>$image,~image</samp>) won't be made redundant by every other rule anymore; a warning is sufficient</li>
      <li><b>Modified</b>prefer the message that <samp>donottrack</samp> is deprecated over one that the rule doesn't match anything</li>
      <li><b>Modified</b>rewrite the way hiding rules are parsed. This method should be more fail-proof.</li>

      <li><b>Fix</b>rules with included domains, excluded subdomains and included sub-subdomains weren't shown as redundant for the last subdomain (<samp>a,~b.a,c.b.a##x</samp> versus <samp>c.b.a##x.y</samp>)</li>
      <li><b>Fix</b>simplified hiding rules suggest the <samp>#id</samp> and <samp>.class</samp> syntax, instead of <samp>[id=&quot;the_id&quot;]</samp> and <samp>[class~=&quot;the_class&quot;]</samp></li>
      <li><b>Fix</b>warnings involving the same rule twice were removed (<samp>##[id=&quot;x&quot;]</samp> and <samp>##[id=&quot;x&quot;]</samp>)</li>

          <li>Tools to ignore domains and blocking options (replaces the checkbox)</li>
          <li>A tool to use a less strict matching algorithm</li>
          <li>A tool to find rules which have the same rule, but a different domain</li>

      <li><b>Fix</b><samp>*!x</samp> and similar will no longer trigger <em>unnecessary preceding wildcard found</em> warnings, since it would become a comment without <samp>*</samp></li>
      <li><b>Fix</b><samp>/\|\|x/</samp> and similar regex rules no longer make <samp>||x</samp> redundant</li>
    </ul>
